Hi my name is Adrian Sumner.

I am currently working as a Payroll Specialist at a large bank holding company in the US. I thought that I wanted to pursue a career in Finance, but after doing a little research, I decided that tech is for me. I wish to eventually become a data scientist at a FAANG company. Maybe I could even become a full stack engineer!
